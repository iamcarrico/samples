<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  The "<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/upgrade/">Upgrade Insecure Requests</a>"
  <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/">Content Security Policy</a>
  can be used to automatically <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-upgrade-insecure-requests/#example-navigation">upgrade all navigation</a> requests to link to the secure version of the page.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, this is helpful as sites work to implement full <code>https</code> support, but are not ready to deliver with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security">Strict Transport Security</a> headers yet. This will keep users who have already accessed the site securely to remain on the secure sites where applicable.
</p>
<p>
  Like other Content Security Policies, the recommend approach is to enable it via a HTTP
  response header, <code>Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests</code>. However,
  if you do not have control over the underlying web server (as is the case in this demo), an
  <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/#the-meta-tag">alternative</a>
  is to include the
  <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"&gt;</code>
  tag in your HTML's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.
</p>
<div class="output">
  <p>
    The following link explicitly links using <code>http:</code>, URL, <code>http://iamcarrico.github.io/samples/csp-upgrade-insecure-requests-navigation/</code>
    Because this page has <code>Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests</code>
    active, the <code>http:</code> is treated as <code>https:</code>, and the user is kept on the secure page.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://iamcarrico.github.io/samples/csp-upgrade-insecure-requests-navigation/">Insecure link</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: This will only work when the entire domain name (including subdomain) are the same on the page that loaded the link, and the link itself.
  </p>
</div>
